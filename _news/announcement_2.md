The song is characterized by its slow pace and the gentle melody of a piano. While it might initially seem to evoke sadness, Sun explains that the song is meant to bring out a feeling of being overwhelmed with emotions, rather than sadness per se. Through this piece, she hopes to help listeners "tidy up their emotions" and rediscover themselves. This emotional depth is a testament to Sun's artistry and her ability to connect with her audience through her music.
