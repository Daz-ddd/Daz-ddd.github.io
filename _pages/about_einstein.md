I am a first year PhD student at [Department of Information Systems and Analytics](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/about/depts/disa/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). My research interests mainly lie in SiChuan Dishes, Hunan Dishes and Dongbei Dishes.

Thanks to my diligence, my research work has been published in wechat moments, weibo feeds and my phone notes.

I am a fan of Mandopop and I love [孙燕姿 Stefanie Sun](https://music.apple.com/sg/artist/yanzi-sun/83405200)'s and [韦礼安 Wei Bird](https://music.apple.com/sg/artist/weibird/441921723)'s amazing songs.

Next month, I will be back to China. Please follow my blog and check any updates of my eating life.
