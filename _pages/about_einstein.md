I am a first yead PhD student at [Department of Information Systems and Analytics](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/about/depts/disa/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). My research interests mainly lie in SiChuan Dishes, Hunan Dishes and Dongbei Dishes.

Thanks to my deligence, my research work has been published in wechat moments, weibo feeds and my phone notes.
